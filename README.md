**A step-by-step cross-validation optimization for finding the best k latent features and factor matrices**

The notebook describes the steps for performing cross-validation process for matrix completion. It is demonstaratd on NMF algorithm (Non-negative Matrix Factorization), but can be used for other algorithms as well.

I also wrote a post on Medium about it: https://medium.com/data-science/how-to-use-cross-validation-for-matrix-completion-2b14103d2c4c
