**A step-by-step cross-validation optimization for finding the best k latent features and factor matrices**

The notebook describes the steps for performing cross-validation process for matrix completion. It is demonstaratd on NMF algorithm (Non-negative Matrix Factorization), but can be used for other algorithms as well.
